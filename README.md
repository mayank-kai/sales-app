# Sales Dashboard

This is a Sales Dashboard built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for building interactive web applications. The dashboard allows you to filter and explore a sales dataset, and visualize key performance metrics, sales by product line over time, and top 10 customers, products, and total sales by product line.

## Prerequisites

To run this dashboard, you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your computer, as well as the following libraries:

- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Plotly Express



## How to use

1. Download the `sales_data_sample.csv` file and put it in the `data` folder.
2. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt: `streamlit run app.py`
3. The dashboard will open in your web browser. You can use the filters on the sidebar to explore the dataset and visualize the metrics and charts.

## Features

### Filters

The sidebar of the dashboard includes four filters that allow you to filter the dataset:

- Date range filter: choose a start and end date to filter by the order date.
- Product line filter: select one or more product lines to filter by.
- Country filter: select one or more countries to filter by.
- Order status filter: select one or more order statuses to filter by.

### KPI Metrics

The dashboard displays four key performance indicators (KPIs) for the filtered dataset:

- Total sales
- Total orders
- Average sales per order
- Unique customers

The KPIs are displayed in a metric format with the current value and percentage change from the previous value.

### Sales by Product Line Over Time
